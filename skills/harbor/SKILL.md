description: Harbor intake for external work — sweep incoming issues and PRs, verify every claim before disposition, and hand the maintainer a short docket where the only remaining work is signing. Agent-autonomous for facts (inspection, info requests, duplicate linking, security escalation); maintainer-signed for decisions (accept, reject, merge). Use when issues or PRs have piled up, or to check what is ready to pick up.

# Harbor

Harbor is the shipyard's intake. External requests — issues, bug reports, feature requests, and (when enabled) external PRs — arrive as raw noise: unclear, unverified, sometimes duplicated, sometimes already built. Harbor turns that noise into a short docket where every ship has been inspected, every fact has been checked, and the maintainer's only remaining job is to decide.

**The two questions.** Everything harbor does exists so the maintainer only ever answers:

1. **This issue — do it, or not?**
2. **This PR — take it, or not?** (and if taken: does it merge?)

**The authority rule.** Facts are harbor's job — gathering, checking, reproducing, drafting — done autonomously, fully logged. Decisions belong to the maintainer — accepting, rejecting, merging — signed at the desk. Harbor never signs, never merges, never decides. When it drafts, the maintainer's signature is the only thing missing.

**Self-built cargo rule.** Harbor only handles work that arrived from outside. Tickets created by launch C3, navigator maps, or to-tickets flows are agent-ready by construction — harbor must not re-process them.

## The labels

Create these labels if the tracker does not have them (and create them before first use):

`harbor:accepted` · `harbor:need-decision` · `harbor:need-info` · `harbor:rejected` · `harbor:for-maintainer` · `harbor:needs-exploration` · `harbor:merge-ready` · `harbor:changes-requested`

The tracker IS the state — no state files, no ledgers. The tracker and label vocabulary should have been recorded by `/oh-my-claudecode:drydock`; if not, ask once and record the answer in `CLAUDE.md` under the shipyard conventions.

**Language: all tracker artifacts — sheets, dockets, comments, labels — are written in English.** English is the default language of record for harbor output. The only exception is a repository whose `documentLanguage` contract (see `/oh-my-claudecode:drydock`) explicitly establishes another language — follow that contract. **Never follow the language of the maintainer's chat session**: a conversation in any other language changes nothing about what lands on the tracker. Structural tokens (`harbor:` label names, state names) stay byte-stable.

## Sweep — the default command

**Step 0 — bind the tracker, before anything else.** Verify the remote tracker responds (`gh repo view` on the recorded/implicit remote succeeds). If it does, the remote tracker is the ONLY medium for dispositions: every sheet, label, and docket lives there. A local `issues/` directory (or any untracked markdown collection) is **content to inspect, never a tracker to write to** — chaotic repos are full of lookalike directories, and writing dispositions into local files strands them where reporters and maintainers will never see them. If the remote is unreachable, stop and say so — do not fall back to local files.

A sweep then processes the whole harbor in one pass:

1. **The queue.** Three buckets, oldest first: everything at `harbor:accepted`-pending (uninspected arrivals), everything `harbor:need-info` with reporter activity since the last intake note, and anything the maintainer parked for themselves. Draft PRs are not a request surface — skip them. External PRs only when the PR flag was enabled at setup; explicitly named PRs are always handled.
2. **Inspect each arrival** (see The three checks). Facts first, autonomously.
3. **Act where harbor acts alone**: send itemized info requests, link exact duplicates to their parent, escalate security reports to a private channel, post PR change-lists, close exact-duplicate reports citing the parent.
4. **Draft the sheets** for everything that needs a signature and present them as one docket (see The sheets). Batch them — one comment per ship, never a comment per finding.
5. **The reconciliation.** End with the docket summary: how many inspected, accepted, rejected, awaiting info, awaiting signature — and the signature queue as checkable boxes.

## The three checks — run in order, on every arrival

1. **Redundancy.** Search the codebase **by domain concept, not by wording** (use the `CONTEXT.md` glossary) for an existing implementation; then search the open queue for the same underlying report or change. Exact match already in the code → reject as already-built, pointing at where it lives. Exact match already in the queue → link to the parent and reject as duplicate. Fuzzy match → present both to the maintainer at the desk, do not close autonomously.
2. **Prior refusals.** Read the rejection log (`.out-of-scope/` in the repo root). A request resembling a recorded refusal is rejected citing that entry — the argument was made once; it does not get re-made.
3. **Confirmation.** Verify the claim itself. Bug → reproduce from the reporter's steps on the current head. PR → check out the branch, run the relevant tests or commands. Report one of three outcomes: **confirmed** (with the code path), **failed** (with what happened), or **insufficient** (a strong info-request signal). Never disposition on an unverified claim.

Security-sensitive arrivals (leaks, IDOR, auth bypass): stop expanding details publicly on the first sign. Move the conversation to the platform's private vulnerability reporting channel immediately, leave a one-line public acknowledgment, label `harbor:for-maintainer`, and escalate — the maintainer owns everything after that.

## The desk — where decisions are signed

Inspection produces facts; the desk produces decisions. Harbor presents each ship's sheet with a recommendation and waits. The maintainer rules:

- **Accepted** → the implementation list (objective / scope / non-goals / acceptance criteria — the same shape as a navigator mission brief) is attached, and the ship is ready for `execute` (single point) or `launch` (multi-step effort).
- **Rejected** → the reason is recorded; refusals of new capabilities are written to `.out-of-scope/` (why refused, the escape hatch, prior requests) and linked. Already-built rejections point at the code and write nothing to the log.
- **Info requested** → the specific missing facts, itemized, sent to the reporter.
- **For the maintainer** → work only a human can execute (authority, confidentiality, physical presence): attach a mini-list of what to do and what evidence closes it.

The maintainer may also override anything directly ("move #42 to rejected") — trust them, confirm what is about to happen, skip the interview. Quick rulings with attached recommendations can be accepted in one word ("按推荐" / "per recommendation").

A maintainer ruling that answers scope questions returns the ship to the desk for re-disposition; answers land in the sheet. **Once a ship is accepted and claimed by `execute`/`launch`, delivery state lives in that pipeline — harbor stops tracking it.**

## PR loop

A PR is a vessel that already arrived built, so its loop differs from an issue's: after intake says "wanted", the quality survey runs — claim (does it do what it says), standards (repo conventions; hand the deep survey to the review surface rather than stamping it yourself), intent (implements what the linked issue wanted), hygiene (no smuggled changes, sane commits). Findings are consolidated into **one actionable checklist** on the PR; the author iterates; harbor re-runs the dimensions on every new push. All dimensions green → `merge-ready`, presented to the maintainer — **harbor never merges**; merge is outward-facing and irreversible, always the maintainer's signature. Author abandons the loop → surface it in the queue and close on the maintainer's sign-off.

**Sloppy and drive-by PRs** are the norm, not the exception — the loop must survive them:

- **No verifiable claim** (description is empty, "fixes", or does not match anything in the diff): the survey still runs on the diff as-is, and the **first checklist item is "declare what this PR actually does"** — harbor does not guess intent from the diff, does not invent a purpose, and does not disposition "wanted" on an undeclared change.
- **Smuggled content** (tool state files, unrelated refactors, drive-by edits bundled with the claim): named file-by-file in the checklist; each item tells the author to remove it, declare it, or split the PR.
- **Proportionality**: a self-evident trivial fix (a typo, an obvious one-liner that passes the checks) goes **straight to merge-ready** without the intent interview — demanding a manifesto for a comma fix is the same over-processing failure as reviewing nothing at all. The depth of the loop scales with the size and risk of the diff.

## The sheets — output contract

Every tracker comment harbor posts uses plain language and this exact shape. Methodology vocabulary from the shipyard's internal metaphors never appears on the tracker — the maintainer and reporters have not learned the metaphors, and they should not need to.

Verdict emojis: 🟢 accepted · 🟡 need-decision · 🔵 need-info · ⚪ rejected · 🔴 for-maintainer · 🌫️ needs-exploration · 🟣 merge-ready · 🟠 changes-requested. A checkable task list (- [ ]) for every maintainer action; recommendations carry a ➡️ and alternatives so one word accepts them.

**The docket** (one issue per sweep, refreshed each time): count line by verdict, then ✍️ signature queue as checkable boxes, then one small table per state with links. This issue is the maintainer's single reading surface.

## Scope and non-goals

- No daemon, no auto-classification on issue creation, no label sync, no cross-repo aggregation, no SLA timers. Harbor runs when invoked.
- It does not merge, does not track delivery after hand-off, does not chart fog (→ `/oh-my-claudecode:ask-navigator`), does not debug (→ the debugger), does not stamp its own quality review (→ the review surface).
- Tracker backends: GitHub Issues and the local `.scratch/` convention. Other backends are deliberately out of scope — each one is a permanent maintenance surface.
- It never re-argues a recorded refusal; it never closes on a fuzzy match without the maintainer.

## Completion definition

The sweep ends with the docket posted: every arrival inspected with the three checks, every autonomous action taken and logged, one consolidated signature queue with checkable boxes — and the maintainer's total effort for the whole harbor is a handful of one-word signatures.
